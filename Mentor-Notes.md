_Topic: DevMtn Web Development Capstone_

The current state of the _My-Pokedex_ Project has been approved for the Capstone and is passing as of now, but it only has a Fron End. The Student has had issues with coming with ideas with how to begin forming a full Back End. Mentor has suggested the idea that Barret create a Back End that take in a User's Email and give the user a new and different Pokemon every time the user signs into the Site. This, alongside the current Front End, would meet all the other points in the Capstone.

Please see rubric for Capstone below. Only 9 of these requirements must be fulfilled to pass the project. As of 3/28/2024 this Project fulfills all of the Server Requirements and the Front End requirements.
